   * Sends a message asynchronously and returns a [[akka.dispatch.Future]]
   * holding the eventual reply message; this means that the target actor
   * needs to send the result to the `sender` reference provided. The Future
   * will be completed with an [[akka.actor.AskTimeoutException]] after the
   * given timeout has expired; this is independent from any timeout applied
   * while awaiting a result for this future (i.e. in
   * `Await.result(..., timeout)`).
   *
   * <b>This variant will use the `akka.actor.timeout` from the configuration.</b>
   *
   * <b>Warning:</b>
   * When using future callbacks, inside actors you need to carefully avoid closing over
   * the containing actor’s object, i.e. do not call methods or access mutable state
   * on the enclosing actor from within the callback. This would break the actor
   * encapsulation and may introduce synchronization bugs and race conditions because
   * the callback will be scheduled concurrently to the enclosing actor. Unfortunately
   * there is not yet a way to detect these illegal accesses at compile time.
   *
   * <b>Recommended usage:</b>
   *
   * {{{
   *   final Future<Object> f = Patterns.ask(worker, request, timeout);
