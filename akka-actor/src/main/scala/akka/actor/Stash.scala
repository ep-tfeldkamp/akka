/**
 *  The `Stash` trait enables an actor to temporarily stash away messages that can not or
 *  should not be handled using the actor's current behavior.
 *  <p/>
 *  Example:
 *  <pre>
 *    class ActorWithProtocol extends Actor with Stash {
 *      def receive = {
 *        case "open" ⇒
 *          unstashAll {
 *            case "write" ⇒ // do writing...
 *            case "close" ⇒
 *              unstashAll()
 *              context.unbecome()
 *            case msg ⇒ stash()
 *          }
 *        case "done" ⇒ // done
 *        case msg    ⇒ stash()
 *      }
 *    }
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  Note that the `Stash` trait can only be used together with actors that have a deque-based
 *  mailbox. Actors can be configured to use a deque-based mailbox using a configuration like
 *  the following (see the documentation on dispatchers on how to configure a custom
 *  dispatcher):
 *  <pre>
 *  akka {
 *    actor {
 *      my-custom-dispatcher {
 *        mailboxType = "akka.dispatch.UnboundedDequeBasedMailbox"
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 *  </pre>
