/**
 * Provides test framework agnostic methods to dump the artery flight recorder data after a test has completed - you
 * must integrate the logic with the testing tool you use yourself.
 *
 * The flight recorder must be enabled and the flight recorder destination must be an absolute file name so
 * that the akka config can be used to find it. For example you could ensure a unique file per test using
 * something like this in your config:
 * {{{
 *   akka.remote.artery.advanced.flight-recorder {
 *     enabled=on
 *     destination=target/flight-recorder-${UUID.randomUUID().toString}.afr
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * You need to hook in dump and deletion of files where it makes sense in your tests. (For example, dump after all tests has
 * run and there was a failure and then delete)
