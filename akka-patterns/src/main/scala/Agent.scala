/**
* The Agent class was strongly inspired by the agent principle in Clojure. Essentially, an agent wraps a shared mutable state
* and hides it behind a message-passing interface. Agents accept messages and process them on behalf of the wrapped state.
* Typically agents accept functions / commands as messages and ensure the submitted commands are executed against the internal
* agent's state in a thread-safe manner (sequentially).
* The submitted functions / commands take the internal state as a parameter and their output becomes the new internal state value.
* The code that is submitted to an agent doesn't need to pay attention to threading or synchronization, the agent will
* provide such guarantees by itself.
* See the examples of use for more details.
