/**
* The Agent class was strongly inspired by the agent principle in Clojure. 
* Essentially, an agent wraps a shared mutable state and hides it behind 
* a message-passing interface. Agents accept messages and process them on 
* behalf of the wrapped state.
* 
* Typically agents accept functions / commands as messages and ensure the 
* submitted commands are executed against the internal agent's state in a 
* thread-safe manner (sequentially).
* 
* The submitted functions / commands take the internal state as a parameter 
* and their output becomes the new internal state value.
* 
* The code that is submitted to an agent doesn't need to pay attention to 
* threading or synchronization, the agent will provide such guarantees by itself.
*
* If an Agent is used within an enclosing transaction, then it will participate
* in that transaction. 
* 
* Example of usage:
* <pre>
* val agent = Agent(5)
*
* agent send (_ + 1)
* agent send (_ * 2)
*
* val result = agent()
* ... // use result
*
* agent.close
* </pre>
* 
* Example of monadic usage:
* <pre>
* val agent1 = Agent(3)
* val agent2 = Agent(5)
*
* for {
*   first <- agent1
*   second <- agent2
*   if first == second
* } process(first, second)
*
* agent1.close
* agent2.close
* </pre>
* 
* NOTE: You can't call 'agent.get' or 'agent()' within an enclosing transaction since 
* that will block the transaction indefinitely. But 'agent.send' or 'Agent(value)' 
* is fine.
