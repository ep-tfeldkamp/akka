/**
* The Agent class was strongly inspired by the agent principle in Clojure. 
* Essentially, an agent wraps a shared mutable state and hides it behind 
* a message-passing interface. Agents accept messages and process them on 
* behalf of the wrapped state.
* 
* Typically agents accept functions / commands as messages and ensure the 
* submitted commands are executed against the internal agent's state in a 
* thread-safe manner (sequentially).
* 
* The submitted functions / commands take the internal state as a parameter 
* and their output becomes the new internal state value.
* 
* The code that is submitted to an agent doesn't need to pay attention to 
* threading or synchronization, the agent will provide such guarantees by itself.
* 
* Example of usage:
* <pre>
* val agent = Agent(5)
*
* agent update (_ + 1)
* agent update (_ * 2)
*
* val result = agent()
* ... // use result
*
* agent.close
* </pre>
